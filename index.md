### Understanding the dynamics of genetic incompatibilities

During my PhD, I became fascinated by how genetic incompatibilities accumulate between diverging lineages. This biological question has a long history; even Darwin was puzzled by the existence of sterile hybrids between different species. Why would natural selection allow for such a wasteful mating? Genetic incompatibilities provide one answer to this puzzle: beneficial or neutral mutations can fix during divergence of two populations and these mutations could turn out to be incompatible - i.e., result in inviable or sterile offspring - when brought together. During my PhD, I tried to extend the theoretical framework in which incompatibilities are studied; an attempt that resulted in [a fascinating paper](kalirad17a.pdf), in collaboration with the inimitable Ricardo Azevedo.
